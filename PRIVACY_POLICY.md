# Kwenta Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 19, 2026

Kwenta ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data Kwenta collects, how it is used, and your choices.

This policy applies to the Kwenta mobile application.

## 1. What Kwenta Does

Kwenta is a debt tracking and bill-splitting app. Core features include:

- personal debt tracking
- group expense splitting
- payment recording

Kwenta is currently designed as an **offline-first** app.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Information you enter in the app

When you use Kwenta, you may enter:

- names or nicknames for people
- debt and payment records
- group names and member lists
- notes, categories, and amounts
- dates and other transaction details

### B. Device/local app data

To run the app, Kwenta stores app data locally on your device (for example, in local app storage/database files).

### C. Account and sync data (when available)

If account linking, cloud sync, or collaboration features are enabled in your version of Kwenta, related account and sync metadata may be processed to provide those features.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use data to:

- provide core app functionality
- calculate balances and settlement suggestions
- save your records and settings
- improve reliability, security, and user experience
- support features you enable (such as sync/collaboration)

We do **not** sell your personal information.

## 4. Data Storage and Processing

- **Local-first behavior:** Most app data is stored on your device.
- **Cloud features (if enabled):** Some data may be transmitted to remote infrastructure to support account-based or sync features.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties for advertising resale purposes.

We may share limited data only when needed to:

- provide infrastructure/services (for example, hosting, authentication, sync)
- comply with legal obligations
- protect rights, safety, and security

## 6. Data Retention

We keep data for as long as needed to provide the app and comply with legal obligations.

For local-only usage, data remains on your device unless you delete the app data or uninstall the app.

For cloud-enabled usage, data may be retained until account deletion or as required for legal, fraud, security, or backup purposes.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- access your data
- correct inaccurate data
- request deletion of your data
- object to or restrict some processing

You can also:

- edit or delete records within the app
- clear local app data from your device settings
- request account/data deletion (for cloud-enabled accounts)

## 8. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect data. No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Kwenta is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 10. International Users

If cloud services are used, your information may be processed in countries different from your own, subject to applicable law.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Effective date" above and, where required, provide additional notice.
